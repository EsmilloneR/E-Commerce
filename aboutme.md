Good day! My name is Esmillone Rosal. I’m a 3rd-year IT student from Andres Soriano Colleges of Bislig.

I have experience in assembling computers, fixing simple system problems, and installing software. I also passed the Computer Systems Servicing NCII assessment.

I know the basics of HTML, CSS, PHP, Python, and Laravel, and I enjoy learning about how computers and coding work. I also joined IT competitions like HackForGov and PSITE Programming where I gained more knowledge.

I am a fast learner, hardworking, and willing to grow through real work experience. I’m excited to learn from your team and give my best during this internship.



2. What are your technical skills?
   I know how to assemble computers, install Windows or Linux, and fix common hardware or software problems.
   I can also set up basic networks and install drivers. I have beginner skills in HTML, CSS, PHP, Python, and Laravel.

3. How do you troubleshoot a computer that won’t turn on?
   First, I check the power cable and outlet. Then I look inside to see if the parts like RAM and power supply are okay.
   I try removing some parts and test one by one to find what’s wrong. I stay calm and follow a step-by-step process.

4. How do you work in a team?
   I listen to my teammates and help when needed. I share my ideas and respect others.
   I believe working together and helping each other makes the project better and faster.

5. Why should we hire you as our intern?
   I’m willing to learn and work hard. I already have basic IT skills, and I want to improve more.
   I’m responsible, fast learner, and I want to gain real experience in a company like yours.
